                            <p>
                                The corn snake is one of the most popular pet snakes in the reptile world thanks to its small size (2 to 6 feet when full grown), general hardiness, and large variety of
                                available color morphs. They're named for the fact that they're often found preying on the rodents that accumulate near grain and corn stores.
                                Corn snakes respond well to handling, and are extremely docile and disinclined to bite. In the wild, they live for about 6 to 8 years, but in captivity, they can live
                                for up to 20.

                            <p>
                                The ball python is another extremely popular pet snake as a result of its small size and general ease of care. Their name comes from the way that
                                they respond to perceived danger by curling themselves up into a ball. Males of this species tend to climb more than females, which generally prefer to spend
                                more time on the ground. As adults, they grow to about 4 to 5 feet, and can live up to 30 years in captivity.

                            <h3>Western Hognose</h3>
                            <p>
                                The western hognose snake is named for its characteristic upturned snout, which they use for burrowing into the ground in the wild.
                                While generally easy to care for, they can be extremely picky eaters in captivity, often requiring their food to be scented with one of
                                their natural prey items in the wild, like toads. If they can be made to eat, however, their expected lifespan in captivity is 15 to 20 years.
                                They're small snakes, rarely growing longer than 2 to 3 feet long.

                            <p>
                                The garter snake is unique among snakes in that it's one of only a few species that do best living communally. In addition, unlike their egg-laying brethren,
                                garter snakes are <em>ovoviviparous,</em> meaning their eggs hatch within the body of the parent and are born live.

                                The Arabian Sand Boa has a face so distinct that it almost doesn't look real. In the wild, their upturned
                                eyes enable them to see out of the sand without popping their head up all the way.
