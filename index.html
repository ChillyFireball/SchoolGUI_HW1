                            <h3>Corn Snake</h3>
                            <p>
                                The corn snake is one of the most popular pet snakes in the reptile world thanks to its small size (2 to 6 feet when full grown), general hardiness, and large variety of
                                available color morphs. They're named for the fact that they're often found preying on the rodents that accumulate near grain and corn stores.
                                Corn snakes respond well to handling, and are extremely docile and disinclined to bite. In the wild, they live for about 6 to 8 years, but in captivity, they can live
                                for up to 20.

                            <h3>Ball Python</h3>
                            <p>
                                The ball python is another extremely popular pet snake as a result of its small size and general ease of care. Their name comes from the way that
                                they respond to perceived danger by curling themselves up into a ball. Males of this species tend to climb more than females, which generally prefer to spend
                                more time on the ground. As adults, they grow to about 4 to 5 feet, and can live up to 30 years in captivity.

                            <h3>Western Hognose</h3>
                            <p>
                                The western hognose snake is named for its characteristic upturned snout, which they use for burrowing into the ground in the wild.
                                While generally easy to care for, they can be extremely picky eaters in captivity, often requiring their food to be scented with one of
                                their natural prey items in the wild, like toads. If they can be made to eat, however, their expected lifespan in captivity is 15 to 20 years.
                                They're small snakes, rarely growing longer than 2 to 3 feet.

                            <h3>Garter Snake</h3>
                            <p>
                                The garter snake is unique among snakes in that it's one of only a few species that do best living communally. In addition, unlike their egg-laying brethren,
                                garter snakes are <em>ovoviviparous,</em> meaning their eggs hatch within the body of the parent and are born live. If they feel threatened, they may musk the
                                perceived threat with scent glands at the base of their tail.

                            <p>
                                The bullsnake is a medium-sized snake that grows to around 3 to 5 feet. Like rattlesnakes, they vibrate their tails as a defensive maneuver. (Unlike rattlesnakes,
                                the tail doesn't make a rattling sound.) While temperment varies between individual snakes, juvenile bullsnakes are known for being a bit more ornery than adults.
                                They live for about 12 years in the wild, but in captivity, their lifespan is closer to 30.

                            <p>
                                The Arabian Sand Boa has a face so distinct that it almost doesn't look real. In the wild, their upturned
                                eyes enable them to see out of the sand without popping their head up all the way. While they aren't difficult
                                to keep in captivity, they're rare in the pet trade. Additionally, sand boas are unpopular due to their tendency
                                to remain buried and out of sight most of the time.

                            <p>
                                Dragon snakes have raised scales along their spine that make them look, as the name would imply, quite similar to a dragon. Unlike
                                their namesake, however, they're extremely skinny and fragile. While some people keep them as pets, they're difficult to breed in
                                captivity, meaning most captive specimens are caught in the wild.

                            <p>
                                The bush viper is a rare snake that can only be found in tropical regions in Africa. While beautiful, they're also incredibly
                                venomous. This venom can cause internal hemorrhaging, making it potentially fatal if untreated. Because of how unlikely it is
                                for a human to encounter this snake in the wild, however, there is no antivenom.
